## Description
The Science Research Activity Support System (SRASS) was designed to meet the specific requirements of the FPT University, Ho Chi Minh Campus's Library and Research Department. Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of managing scientific conferences, with the initial deployment taking place at the HCM Campus. The basic idea behind this project is to establish a system to support conference management activities and coordinate activities of conference attendees: PC chairs, authors, and reviewers, from the initial phase when the individual accountable for managing a conference receives the approved conference plan up to the end of the conference.

For over two decades, FPT Education has been on a transformative journey, guided by a steadfast vision known as iGSM (Industry-Relevant - Global - Smart Education - Mega). This vision is firmly grounded in the aspiration to become an internationally recognized mega-education system that aligns with societal demands and harnesses state-of-the-art educational technologies. With a history marked by growth and innovation, FPT Education has established itself as a pioneer in the field of education.
At the heart of FPT Education, FPT University plays a pivotal role by organizing numerous annual academic initiatives to promote research and innovation. However, as scientific conferences evolve to enhance research and innovation, FPT University encounters challenges in optimizing the management process. Currently, this process encompasses the following sequential activities:
1.	Input Conference Plan 
2.	Configure Conference Preferences 
3.	Initiate a Call for Research Papers 
4.	Appoint Paper Reviewers 
5.	Finalize Paper Decisions 
6.	Communicate Decision Results 
7.	Request for Camera Readies 
8.	Request Presentation Materials 
9.	Produce Reports

This is a sophisticated process. Furthermore, this process largely depends on the experience of the person responsible for managing these conferences to run smoothly. This would impose a restriction on the effectiveness of the standard procedures.
